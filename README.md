## Hello there :milky_way:

####  :alien: I’m currently working on my NodeJS backend (design patterns, good practices, unit tests and communications using Web Sockets) and DevOps (just the basics about process and I/O management, Docker, Kubernetes and basic server configuration)
#### 🧠 I am currently learning better ways to structure my code. I also practice my Javascript daily and learning more about Ethereum for later use.
####  :octocat: I'm looking to collaborate on cryptocurrency and javascript implementations, i would prefer find a Ethereum + Typescript project than a purple horn unicorn :unicorn:
#### :thinking: I'm looking for help with DevOps and Blockchain. Both topics gimme butterflies in the stomach, I'm not planning on go 'all-in' on one of those topics (yet). But I sure want to go through the basics.
#### :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me: I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold. :movie_camera: :vhs: 🦇☎️
